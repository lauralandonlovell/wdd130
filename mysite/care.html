                    According to the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information, Teckels are a breed of dog whose dwarfism is caused by simultaneous inheritance of two retrogenes. These genes tell the body to stop growth in the legs when the dog is still a puppy. The Teckel's unique body shape is perfect for the work they love and were bred to do. However, even if the dogs are working dogs and in great shape, because of their morphology they can be plagued with back problems such as Intervertebral Disc Disease, or IVDD, at higher rates than are seen in other dog breeds.(Bannasch et al,"The Effects of FGF4 Retrogenes on Canine Morphology"| https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35205370/| Genes| U.S. Natl. Library of Medicine|2022)

                    Dogs that are out of shape can be prone to herniated discs, Intervertebral Disc Disease, and other spinal problems. Most Teckel owners don't live on farms or in the country, so how can Teckels get enough exercise to lessen the severity of these painful problems?

                    Always use a harness collar instead of a traditional neck collar to attach the leash.
                    Crate your pet for short amounts of time when you cannot supervise their activity.
                    Place pet ramps leading up to and away from furniture.
                    Carry your pet up and down stairs.
                    Pay close attention to your Teckel's diet.

                    New research, such as that highlighted in this article, has the potential to mitigate hereditary risk of Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) in Teckels. Radiography (taking x-rays) of Teckels between two and four years of age has been shown to be a more effective tool than DNA testing in predicting genetic risk for this degenerative spinal disease. Calcified spinal discs are easy to see in x-rays. Dr. Proschowsky, a WSAVA member and co-author of the study, recommends that all countries should require potential breeders to have radiograph tests of their dogs before breeding in order to decrease the instance of this disease, especially in Teckels and Dachshunds. Finland already has such a plan in place. It is helping the dogs bred there to possibly avoid this painful disease, and if it does occur, to present in less severe forms. According to Dr. Helle Friis Proschowsky (WSAVA Hereditary Disease Committee Member), "IVDD affects one Dachshund in five". Compared to other dog breeds, according to cgejournal.biomedcentral.com, Teckels "are 10-12 times higher risk of IVDD than other Breeds".

M. A., et al| "Canine Genetics and Epidemiology" 3:8(2016)| cgejournal.biomedcentral.com| Canine Medicine and Genetics| 5 Nov. 2016| 18 Nov. 2022).
