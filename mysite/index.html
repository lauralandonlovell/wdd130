                <p class="history">
                    Originally a dog bred for hunting in Germany, Teckels are more than capable of keeping those pesky weasels on your farm in check. Teckels specialize in flushing out and hunting badgers, rabbits, and other ground burrowing animals. Dachshund, another German name for the Teckel, means “badger dog”. Today this unique heritage is what gives Teckels their distinctive bark and thick tail. A hunter’s best friend, they are great diggers and love to chase game. The Teckel's strong slim body, short legs, and barrel chest make for a fast and fearless hunting dog. Enthusiasm for the hunt can get them in trouble sometimes. Teckels can get stuck in underground burrows while flushing out game. Hunters and farmers safely retrieve this little helper with a painless tug on the Teckel’s strong tail; a feature that was bred into the dog for just such a purpose.

                    Teckels are great watchdogs. No need for a smart home when you have a Teckel around! Teckels will let you know when someone is approaching your door before your doorbell knows. The excellent hearing and sensitive nose of the Teckel give them the tools they need to bolster your home security system. Equipped with a sharp bark, Teckels can give their owners a heads up when there is anything out of the norm in their environment.
