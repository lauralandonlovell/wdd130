 <h2>Laura Landon-Lovell.</h2>
 <p>
 <h2>Je m'appelle Laura.</h2>
 <p>I live in the GMT +2 time zone, in the  Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France. I am originally from the western United States.<p>As an older student, I am excited to get another opportunity to pursue my education.</p> Last year I restarted my educational journey with PathwayConnect. I loved that program, and I am now in my first semester at BYU-Idaho in computer programming.<p>My husband Dustin and I love to walk down by the river (La Vienne) that is close to our apartment. </p>
