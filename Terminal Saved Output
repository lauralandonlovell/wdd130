       <p>Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the <strong>beauty</strong> that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>
       <h2>We run Rivers to relax.</h2>

       <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for <em>relaxing</em>. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating.</p>
